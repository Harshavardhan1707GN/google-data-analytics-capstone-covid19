# üìä Google Data Analytics Capstone: COVID-19 SQL Analysis

This project is the final capstone case study for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.  
It demonstrates real-world data exploration and analysis using **SQL** on the **COVID-19 public dataset** in Google BigQuery.

---

## üß† Problem Statement

Analyze the impact of COVID-19 across the world by answering key questions related to:
- Confirmed cases
- Death trends
- Vaccination efforts
- Country-level comparisons

The goal is to practice data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using SQL and BigQuery, and to communicate meaningful insights through data storytelling.

---

## üîß Tools Used

- **Google BigQuery** (BigQuery Public Datasets)
- **Standard SQL**
- **Google Sheets** *(for optional visualization)*
- **Python (optional)*
- **PNG Charts** generated from query results

---

## üìÇ Dataset Used

- Dataset: `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
- Source: [Google BigQuery Public Datasets](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/covid19-open-data)

---

## üìà Key Insights

- **India** saw a major spike in COVID-19 cases between Jan‚ÄìJune 2021.
- **USA** recorded the highest number of new daily deaths in December 2021.
- **Vaccination rates** were highest in countries like the United States and India by the end of 2021.
- Countries with high case numbers did not always have the highest fatality rates, showing varying healthcare responses.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Reproduce This Project

1. Open [Google BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)
2. Navigate to:  
   `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
3. Copy and run the SQL queries listed above
4. Export the results to Google Sheets or use a CSV for visualization
5. Create visuals using tools like Google Sheets, Python (Matplotlib), or Excel
6. Document insights based on the visualizations

## üìå SQL Questions Explored

1. **Top 10 Countries with Highest Confirmed Cases**
   ```sql
   SELECT country_name, MAX(cumulative_confirmed) AS total_cases
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE date = '2021-12-31'
   GROUP BY country_name
   ORDER BY total_cases DESC
   LIMIT 10;
2. **Trend of New Cases in India (Jan to Jun 2021)**
   ```sql
   SELECT date, new_confirmed
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE country_name = 'India'
   AND date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-06-30'
   ORDER BY date;
3.Top 10 Countries with Highest Vaccination Rate (2021)
  ```sql
   SELECT country_name, MAX(cumulative_persons_vaccinated) AS total_vaccinated
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
   WHERE date = '2021-12-31'
   AND cumulative_persons_vaccinated IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY country_name
   ORDER BY total_vaccinated DESC
   LIMIT 10;
